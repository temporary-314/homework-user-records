# homework-user-records

## Installation

This project uses Clojure Tools Deps, see [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) for details.

## Useful Commands

### Run Tests: 
`clj -A:test:test-runner`


### Generate Sample Files: 
`clj -X:gen-samples`

This will cause three sample files to be generated with random user records 
under the `resources` directory with names matching `sample.*`. 
Existing files will be overwritten as applicable.


### Run Step 1 
`clj -X:step-1`

This will execute the code corresponding to the Step 1 prompt, reading the sample files.

To override the files read, run `clj -X:step-1 :base-filename "resources/example"`
Where `"resources/example"` is the extensionless name of the file(s) you wish to read.

The program will scan for all relevant extensions for the base name (psv, csv, ssv)

### Run Step 2
`clj -M:run [base-filename] [port]`
Both parameters are optional
This will start a server on `port`, 
starting with the records denoted by `base-filename` (considered as per step 1)

`base-filename` defaults to `resources/sample` (the files generated by `clj -X:gen-samples`.
`port` defaults to 8080
